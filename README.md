### Note This service performs operations using both way  
+ Through Rest APIs (find more here [Alfresco Content Services REST API](https://api-explorer.alfresco.com/api-explorer/))
+ Through SDK provided by alfresco (find more here [Alfresco Java SDK](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-java-sdk))

In order to use any of the above approach simply toggle the flag inside ```appliation.yml custom.using-sdk=true```
